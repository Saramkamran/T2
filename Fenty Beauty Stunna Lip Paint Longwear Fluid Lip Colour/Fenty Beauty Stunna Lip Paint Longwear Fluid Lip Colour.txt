Product details
A weightless, 12-hour liquid lipstick with a soft matte finish – born in a range of head-turning shades that look incredible on all skin tones.

When life’s all about taking risks, wearing liquid lipstick shouldn’t be one of them. Enter Stunna Lip Paint: The love child of high-impact colour and low-maintenance longwear – now in a range of head-turning shades that’s got everyone’s name on them. Each shade was hand-picked by Rihanna and created to look incredible on everyone.

Equal parts class and sass, Stunna Lip Paint goes from zero to 100 in one stroke of its lip-defining precision wand, making it easier than ever to dress your entire pout in show-stopping, soft matte pigment. Its serious 12-hour hold is so weightless, if it weren’t for the non-stop compliments, you’d forget you were even wearing it. And if that weren’t enough – Stunna Lip Paint won’t feather, staying kissably smooth. In other words, it behaves so you don’t have to.

“I wanted a lipstick that wouldn’t budge – even as you eat, even as you make out. It’s a 12-hour formula, which is one of my favourite things about it. It really lasts all day and is there no matter what you do!”

FENTY Beauty is 100% cruelty free.
